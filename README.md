# React Native Android Widget
Trial/proof of concept to create a working Android widget connection with expo
Once working, will integrate with socket.io for real-time events between devices

# How it works
A native android widget communicates with React Native's NativeModules package.
We created a native android class `SharedStorage` which allows for communication between our RN app and the widget.
